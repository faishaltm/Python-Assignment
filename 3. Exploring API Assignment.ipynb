       "  \"text\": \"Hello everyone, my name is Daniel Guetta and I'm one of the professors here at the Business School. I teach some of our analytics electives and hopefully we'll get to meet at some point during your time at Columbia. Today, I want to talk to you about Columbia Business School's Python curriculum, not the snake, but the programming language. The world runs on Python, Instagram, Spotify, Pinterest, Reddit, and so many more services you use and love all run on the language. Beyond websites, thousands of companies around the world use Python for data analytics, machine learning, and data science, from Instacart to AQR, from Nike to the SEC. Based on LinkedIn postings, it's also the most in-demand programming language in the world. In fact, Python will be to you what Excel was to business school students 20 years ago. Even if you won't be using it yourself, you're almost guaranteed to work with people who will, and being able to communicate with them and understand what they're doing is going to be crucial. If you're hoping to work at Amazon or Google or Facebook or somewhere similar, you might even need to know basic Python for your interviews when you go through recruiting. Luckily for you, we at Columbia Business School have one of the best and most comprehensive Python programs you can get at any school in the US. And I want to tell you a little bit more about it so that you can get the most out of it. There are three levels to the program to make it maximally flexible to you. The first level will teach you Python basics, and it's designed for people who think Python is a snake. We'll teach you everything from scratch. By the end of it, you should know what Python is all about and be able to pass a basic coding interview. The second level digs into essential ways Python can be used in business. We cover data analytics, scraping websites, automating emails, and more. By the end of this level, you should be able to actually use Python to carry out some basic but essential business operations. Finally, the third level covers more advanced applications, including AI, machine learning, and deeper applications to specific areas. We're adding classes to this level every year. All right, so this all sounds fabulous, but where do you begin? Well, level one is not a class. It's actually a series of self-guided videos recorded by me in which I'll guide you through everything you need to know. We also have a veritable army, a phalanx of amazing engineering master's students who are going to be available to help you as you go through the videos on Slack or during workshops which will run early each semester. So you get the best of both worlds, help from humans and also a self-guided experience. At the end of level one, you'll have to take the basic Python qualification exam to prove you've mastered that level. It'll be required to take classes at level two. If you know Python already, you can jump straight to the exam. If you like, you can also learn this material by reading part one of Python for MBAs, a book I co-authored, and that you can download for free by going to the Columbia University Libraries website and searching for it. Level two is all about digging into applications of Python in business. The main class at this level is Python for MBAs taught by a rotating cast of all-star faculty. You'll learn how to read, write, and analyze massive data sets Excel couldn't even dream of handling, scrape websites, automate emails, and more. You can find the other classes at this level listed on the school's Python website. Finally, level three is the most advanced level. To be eligible for classes at this level, you either have to take the advanced Python qualification exam or achieve an H- or higher in Python for MBAs. Again, all the classes at this level are listed online. They include classes on machine learning as well as in-depth classes focusing on specific areas of business. So hopefully I've convinced you it'll be worth your time to pursue some Python while you're at CBS. If you want any more information on the curriculum, the qualification exams, or really anything else, simply go to this website or email this address and our friendly Python team will be happy to help. I hope our paths cross while you're at Columbia, and in the meantime, all the very best of luck.\"\n",
