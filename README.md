# Python-Assignment
These files are my assignments from a Python Course at Columbia University.

As I don't have a professional background in working with Python, the assignments will showcase my capabilities of using Python to explore data and APIs and to answer business queries.

## First Assignment: Answering CEO's Queries
The course instructor gave students a dataset to explore and answer the CEO's question, similar to a real-case situation in which some people didn't have the basics of EDA.
The students were expected to guess and provide the best possible answers in responding to the CEO's queries.

## Second Assignment: Exploring Public Dataset.
Students were assigned to explore publicly available datasets, such as FRED, Government Data, etc. </br>
In this assignment, I chose the NYC Health Database related to COVID-19 as the dataset provided me with a comprehensive picture of COVID-19's impact on NYC, grouped by time, economic class, etc. 

## Third Assignment: Exploring API.
To gain an understanding of retrieving datasets from big datasets, students are expected to know how the API works. The assignment is not limited to Data API but several API applications, such as OpenAI, Twillio, Weather Data, and others.
I took OpenAI API and started to explore LLM capabilities.

## Forth Assignment: Creating Python Project
Based on the given materials from the class, students can explore and create their own projects and analysis using Python.</br>
In this assignment, I chose to create a customer service agent that can interact with the database using LangChain on Python. LLM served as the brain for the agent to respond to user queries and work with the defined tools (e.g., connect and query to an RDB).
